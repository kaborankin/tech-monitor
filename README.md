# Reddit Tech Discussion Monitor

This repository will contain a small external tool that uses the Reddit API to
retrieve publicly available posts and comments from selected subreddits related
to web development (e.g., Next.js, React, Prisma, cloud technologies).

The purpose of this tool is to identify common issues, questions, and patterns
in developer discussions so I can improve my development workflow and the
quality of the documentation, examples, and technical content I create for my
projects, including my SaaS application TenderIQ.

This tool:
- Only reads publicly available content
- Does not store personal data or create user profiles
- Does not automate any interactions on Reddit
- Does not post, comment, or message users

The script will run externally and is not designed to work inside the Devvit
ecosystem.
